The basic principles and practices of interactive computer graphics and multimedia systems are covered in this introductory course. The design and implementation of state-of-the-art computer graphic rendering and visual multimedia systems are the main part of the course. The sub-topics of the course deal with specific input/output hardware devices and their technology, software and hardware standards, programming methods for implementing 3-dimensional graphical applications and interactive multimedia applications, and a study and evaluation of the effectiveness of graphic/multimedia communications. A large component of the class is the building of a large-scale application.
