/*
 * This example is more complex since there are two different shader programs to support
 * two different rendering setups:
 *  * Rendering a scene made of parts
 *  * Rendering the 'view in view'
 *
 *  The scene made of parts is actually going to be rendered twice on each iteration
 *  of the event loop
 *
 *   * Render to a texture contained in a frame buffer to paint on the view-in-view
 *   * Render to the usual default render buffer in the visible window
 *
 *    The view-in-view, just a rectangle, will always be rendered directly to the
 *    window frame buffer.
 *
 *
 *  Each set of shader programs has its own file
 *  * setup_parts.cpp for the parts making the main scene
 *  * setup_view_in_view for the view-in-view rectangle
 *
 *  Each file contains a display function for rendering using the corresponding shaders
 *  and an init function for setting things up.
 *  The parts file also has functions to change the rendering target to a framebuffer or to
 *  a window.
 *  The sharing.h include file is used by this file to access those six functions as needed.
