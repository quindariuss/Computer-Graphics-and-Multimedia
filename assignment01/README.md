# Assignment 1: One Point

## Getting Started

Start with the project assignment0 in the archive assignment01-yymmdd-hhmm.zip. The name of the archive ends with a time stamp. For example assignment01-210520-2201.zip was created on May 20, 2021 at 10:01 PM. Look in the projects directory for the version with the latest time stamp.

You will be making changes to this project.

## Requirements

- [ ] Problem One
  - [ ] Change the point size to 200
  - [ ] Change the Color to Slate Blue 3
    - The color components of Slate Blue 3 are red 105, green 89, blue 205, and alpha 255. This is the standard description using color components in the range from 0 to 255.
    - Use the values 105, 89, 205, and 255 as they are. The color does not seem to be displaying properly. In a comment at the beginning of the driver file state what the color is and explain why this happened.
- [ ] Problem Two
  - [ ] Change the point size to 200.
  - [ ] The color component values must actually be in the range 0 to 1. So, divide the values by 255. Use 105/255, 89/255, 205/255, and 255/255 exactly as shown here. Again, the color does not seem to be displaying properly. In a comment at the beginning of the driver file state what the color is and explain why this happened.
- [ ] Problem Three
  - [ ] Change the point size to 200.
  - [ ] Try again setting the point color to Slate Blue 3. Use the divisions as you did for problem-2, but make them floating point divisions. This should work.
  - [ ] Change the color of the background to goldenrod: red 218, green 165, blue 32, and alpha 255.
- [ ] Problem Four
  - [ ] Change the coordinates of the point to x = 0, y = 0, and z = .5. In a comment at the beginning of the driver program, describe whether the point is still visible and if it is visible, whether it changed position. If the point is not visible, explain what happened.
- [ ] Problem Five
  - [ ] Change the coordinates of the point to x = 0, y = 0, and z = 1.5. In a comment at the beginning of the driver program, describe whether the point is still visible and if it is visible, whether it changed position. If the point is not visible, explain what happened.
- [ ] Problem Six
  - [ ] Change the coordinates of the point to move it halfway towards the lower right-hand corner of the window.
